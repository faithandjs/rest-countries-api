## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS 
- Large-screen-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS superset

### What I learned

### SASS:
```scss
.proud-of-this-css {
  /*I was able to figure out how to create a light mode/ dark mode effect in css*/
}
```
### Typescript
```ts
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('i wrote the whole project in typescript and that was a first for me')
}
```

### Continued development

I want to do more projects with Typescript and APIs. 
I like how I had to do a lot of thinking to create this project, I want to do mor Frontend Mentor advanced challenges.
